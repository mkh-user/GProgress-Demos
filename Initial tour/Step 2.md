## Step 2: What capabilities does GProgress have?

### Have multiple players!

One of the features of GProgress is that it allows for the separation and management of multiple player data on a single device, ensuring that everything remains specific to that player. 
To create this feature, GProgress utilizes the following capabilities:
- User Slots
- File Based User Management
- Json & Godot FileAccess
- Config Dictionaries
- Unique ID System

### Several progress saved for each user

GProgress allows for the secure storage of players' information by enabling the saving of multiple progress points. This feature operates independently for each user, ensuring that the 
activities of other users do not compromise the information of others. Additionally, each player can save a progress file at any time or revert to one of the saved progress points.

### Exclusive Information for Users

To ensure GProgress is compatible with various games with different capabilities, this plugin provides complete customization options. You can define parameters for each user and entrust 
them to GProgress to ensure their security and accuracy. For example, you can define features such as age, level, highest score, play time, language, and more, so you won't need to do extra work to maintain 
them. Everything can be easily configured in the plugin settings that are added at the bottom of your editor's dock.

### Flexible and Comprehensive Progresses

GProgress supports various data types for saving progress. You can store images, texts, numbers, lists, and any type of data in a progress, and retrieve the saved progress whenever you need it.

### Get previews as much as you need!

You can specify parameters that provide general information about a saved progress, so you do not need to fully load it to know the contents of a saved progress.

### Autosaves & Backups

GProgress supports comprehensive settings for saves and backups, one of which is the ability to set a time interval for automatic game saves, so if the game suddenly closes, 
the player does not lose their progress. GProgress also supports automatic backups; if for any reason the main storage location encounters issues, a backup file can easily be restored to a 
saved progress.

### Compression & Encryption

All saved progress can be compressed and/or encrypted; these two features ensure optimal game performance and data security. (And you can trun these options off in settings)

### Fast, Globalized & Safe

You can use `GPro` in every place in your game for use plugin, all functions have error handling system and have internal type control and documentation.

### Unique ID System

Everything in GProgress has an id, which ensures that access to each of the data generated by the plugin is done with complete certainty.

### Statistics

This plugin provides special internal functions for obtaining statistics, comparisons, and player progress trends, from internal sorters to comparators between players.

### Quick Save

One of the special features of GProgress is the quick save capability, which allows you to use the plugin's features to specify their values without having to manually set 
many attributes of a saved progress.
