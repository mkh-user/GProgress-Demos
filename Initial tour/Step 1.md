## Progress Management and Multi User Support

As a gamer, a game is essentially enjoyable as long as the player's activities do not disappear after each session, and the player's efforts are not in vain. 
For this reason, one important feature in prominent and major games is that your progress in the game, along with the items you acquire and the actions you take, 
is saved for the next time you enter the game. Another very interesting feature that we see in most major games today is the ability to save progress and load it, 
meaning that if you encounter a failure at some point in the game, take a wrong path, or lose your progress for any other reason, you can return the game to a previous 
point to correct everything.

Another feature we want to pursue is the ability to have multiple players on one device, meaning players can have their personal progress in the game while the game is 
installed on only one device. In this context, ultimately, we as game developers need tools that can easily add these capabilities to our games, and this moment is exactly 
the moment for this plugin, GProgress!

### What is progress management?

Progress management is a very important feature in games that significantly enhances game quality and player satisfaction. This can include any of the following: 
- Saving the player's status before exiting the game 
- Automatically loading the player's last status each time the game is launched 
- The ability to save multiple statuses for the player, allowing them to revert to any of them if desired 
- Automatic game saving after a specified period 
- Backing up the player's status in a portable file to ensure data security in case of any issues in the game

### Why we need progress management?

Basically, many games become meaningful when the player strives to progress in the game, which makes the player return to the game and continue playing. Without this, 
games will be aimless and boring. If a player repeatedly does tasks they have previously completed, they will undoubtedly feel dissatisfied with the game, thus this is 
an important feature for many games.

### Multi User Support, What and Why?

The ability to support multiple users means that several players can be supported asynchronously on a single device. If more than one person can play on each device, 
the number of players in the game increases, making competition easier for players.

### Why we need tools for these options?

Implementing these features for any project is very time-consuming, confusing, and complex. Additionally, because it typically requires a large number of connections 
to the game itself, it reduces its flexibility and greatly increases the likelihood of errors. Managing several hundred saves for multiple different players and preventing 
their interference is a very important and complex issue to add to a game development project. Therefore, all developers need tools that can automate, simplify, and accurately 
perform these processes, which saves time and significantly improves the quality of smaller games.

### GProgress is here now!

Now, we give you GProgress, a plugin that performs all this process with complete consistency and accuracy without any errors, while you don't need to write hundreds of lines 
of code to do these tasks!
