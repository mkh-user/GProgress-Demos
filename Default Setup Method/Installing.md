To get started with [GProgress](https://mkh-user.github.io/GProgress/), the first step is to install and activate it. 
In this tutorial, we will show you how to install it for a example project and review the available methods.

# Install
## Download
Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/mkh-user/GProgress/releases) and select the 
[latest version](https://github.com/mkh-user/GProgress/releases/latest) (if you are not a contributor to the debugging team,
downloading pre-releases **is not recommended**, download the latest **stable** version (stable versions are marked with an `S` at the end). 
Scroll down on the Releases page and download `GProgress.zip`.

## Install on Project
If you don’t have a Godot project, create one 
([how?](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/01.project_setup.html#setting-up-the-project)) and open it 
([how?](https://school.gdquest.com/user_guides/opening_a_project_in_godot)). At the top of the editor you will see four options, open 
`AssetLib` and select the downloaded file from the `Import…` option. Make sure the tree under your pop-up tree is the same and the `Ignore asset 
root` option is off and click `Install`. If the installation is successful, a pop-up will be displayed containing a message that the operation was 
successful.
